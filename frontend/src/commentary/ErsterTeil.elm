    """In this section, Fichte presents the three basic principles that will together form the scaffolding of his entire system.  The three principles are as follows:
+ 'The I sets originally absolutely its own being.'
+ 'A Not-I is absolutely set against the I.
+ Both the I and the Not-I are absolutely posited partially.'
As Fichte explains in Section 3, these three claims together contain implicitly everything in his system.  He express the unity of these three claims in the following formulation: 'In the I, I set against the divisible I, a divisible Not-I.'  The first part of the formulation expresses the claim from the first principle that all positing occurs in and by the I.  That the I sets a Not-I over and against the I is covered by the second principle. That fact that the I and the Not-I are positied as divisible is then covered by the third principle.

The Theoretical and Practical Parts of Doctrine of Knowledge then have the task of rendering explicit everything that these three claims together entail./nWe can begin to see how that works looking ahead to what Fichte says at the beginning ofthe Theortical Part.  There are two ways in which the I partially posits both itself and a Not-I.  The first is that the I posits itself as determiend by the Not-I [Get the exact quote], and forms the basis of his theoretical philosophy. The second is.   This layout can be expressed in the following diagram:
