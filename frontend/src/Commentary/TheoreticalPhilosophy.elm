The _Theoretical Part_ of the _Wissenschaftslehre_ is concerned with how we know things about the world.  Fichte's describes it as an investigation into resolving the contradictions contained in the founding principle of theoretical philosophy, which we can simply refer to as the _Theoretical Principle_:
~~~The self sets itself as determined by the Non-Self.
Das Ich setzt sich als bestimmt durch das Nicht-Ich.~~~
We can parse this principle as follows: the knowledge that we have about the world is our knowledge, since we are the ones doing the knowing.  Hence the formulation that 'the self sets itself'.  However, that which we have knowledge of is not of our making, but rather concerns the world. We must comply with what the world presents to us, otherwise it's our invention and not knowledge.  Hence the self is 'determined by the Non-Self.'  Since we are in the theoretical realm, 'mind' is a good stand-in term for the Self, so we can say that we are dealing with the interaction between mind and world, where the mind, in so far as it is focused on the world, takes itself to be determined by the world.


## The outline of _The Theoretical Part_
Fichte's goal is this section is to figure out how the _Theoretical Principle_ is possible.  We can roughly divide the phases of Fichte's investigation into three stages:
1.  In a first stage, Fichte introduces a series of six concepts that he believes are essential to explain the _Theoretical Principle_.
2.  In the second stage, Fichte uses these six concepts to map out various accounts of the _Theoretical Principle_.  These accounts are all versions of _realism_ or _idealism_.
3.  At the conclusion of the second stage, Fichte puts forth a new account that is entirely different in character from the _idealist_ nor _realist_ accounts he has thus far set up. Whereas the previous accounts are all dualist in that they assume a Self and a Not-Self as their starting point, this account is monist, since it takes the Self to be the starting point, and then describes how, a Not-Self emerges from the Self.  This is Fichte's so-caled 'theory of the _check_' (Anstosslehre), and the remainder of the _Theoretical Part_ is devoted to fleshing out this account.

(Note that this three stage division is an artificial construct that is not delineated in the actual text, but that we have introduced for explanatory purposes.)

The guiding thread throughout all three stages of the _Theoretical Part_ are six guiding concepts that Fichte employs in a highly structured manner that we can map out as follows:

This diagram is to be read from top to bottom, and then, approximately, from left to right.  In stage 1, Fichte is introducing his six concepts and explaining how these concepts combine so as to isolate eight different aspects of the _Theoretical Principle_.  In stage two, Fichte is showing how these six concepts, or eight aspects work together to form incomplete accounts of the _Theoretical Principle_.  In stage 3, we then get the complete, or the monist theory of the check.

Let's look at each stage in more detail.

### Stage 1

Fichte begins by introducing two general concepts, causality and substance, that each have a different way of specifying how the _Theoretical Principle_ works.
* _Causality_ says that the Self and the Non-Self stand in a relationship of efficient causality to one another.  Since all positing, according to Fichte's _First Principle_ (or also the _Third Principle_), starts from the Self, the Non-Self only has reality for the Self insofar as the Self posits it.  The question is thus the following: what is causing, or _affecting_, the Self to posit the Non-Self, to endow it with reality, or, as Fichte also formulates it, trasfer activity to the Non-Self? The concept of causality leaves this question open, but limits the answer to two possibilities:
    1. The Self is intiating the action of the _Theoretical Principle_, affecting itself such that it posits the Non-Self.
    2. The Non-Self is initiating the of the _Theoeretical Principle_, affecting the Self, and therefore causing the Self to undergo its positing of the Non-Self.
* _Substance_ says that Self is a substance and the Non-Self is an accident of the Self (not an _accident_ in the sense of a _mistake_, but rather in the formal philosophical sense that green is an accident of the substance tree, for example).  The notion of the Self as a substance follows more or less from the _First_ and _Third Principles_, which says that all positing is done by the Self.  Therefore Fichte can say that the Self contains the set of 'all realities'. The Non-Self is then a subset of that complete set of all realities.

This explains the first division at the top of the diagram.  The next division comes because Fichte wants to develop a more detailed picture of what a causal and a substantial interaction between Self and Non-Self looks like.  In order to do this, he introduces another pair of concepts, _exchange_ and _independent activity_, both of which can be applied to the cases of causality and substance.
* The _exchange of activity and passivity_, also simply called an _exchange_, describes a situation in which one entity is determining another.  Any amount of activity in the one enitity, corresponds to the exact same amount of passivity, or suffering, in the other. The active entity is determining the passive entity, which is absorbing, or taking in the activity of the active entity.  It is called an _exchange_ or _interaction_, because the activity of the one entity fully determines the passivity of the other, and visa versa.  Thus is specificies a formula for _exchanging_ the activity or passivity observed in the one entity with activity or passivity that must be occuring in the other.  The specific exchange that interests Fichte in the _Theoretical Part_ is the activity of the Non-Self and its correspondence to the passivity of the Self.   
* Whereas an exchange of activity and passivity applies to any kind of object, and most notably physical objects, indendent activity is an activity that allows the Self to be aware of the exchange with the Non-Self in which it is engaged.  The first concept, _exchange_ would be enough to explain that the Non-Self determines  Self, for it says that the Non-Self acts on the passive Self.  However, the _Theoretical Principle_ also says that the Self posits itself _as_ determined by the Non-Self.  It is thus important not only that the Non-Self determine the Self, but also that the Self be aware of this determination.  Fichte calls this awareness _independent activity_ because he considers being aware to be an _act_. This _act_ or _activity_ is _independent_ in that it is not caught up in the direct _exchange_ between the Non-Self and the Self.  The passivity of the Self, when it is being determined by the Non-Self, does not affect the activity that goes into being aware of its passivity.   

Fichte now applies these two concepts to the two concepts of causality and substance so as to now describe four different aspects at play in the _Theoretical Principle_.

* Causal exchange: As one would imagine it.

* Causal independent activity: Activity of the Non-Self.

* Substantial exchange: A second state comes in that negates the totality of the first state.

* Substantial indendendent activity: Imagination.  Comparing the signle state to the shared state.

The last step involves introducing the formal and material aspects of these four aspects.
Fichte defines form and matter in a very abstract manner.

Matter and form are guided by the notions of sensuous matter and form.  It takes some effort to see this.


### Stage 2
  What does it mean to have one concept 'determine' the other?  What does it mean to have form determine matter, and visa versa? The matter explains the form.  The form explains the matter.


### Stage 3
 The tendency of _The Theoretical Part_.
