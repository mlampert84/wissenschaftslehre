The _Theoretical Part_ of the _Wissenschaftslehre_ is concerned with how we know things about the world.  Fichte's describes it as an investigation into resolving the contradictions contained in the founding principle of theoretical philosophy, which we can simple refer to as the _Theoretical Principle_:
~~~The self sets itself as determined by the Non-Self.
Das Ich setzt sich als bestimmt durch das Nicht-Ich.~~~
The knowledge that we have about the world is our knowledge, since we are the ones doing the knowing.  Hence the formulation that 'the self sets itself'.  However, that which we have knowledge of is not of our making, but rather concerns the world. We must comply with what the world presents to us, otherwise it's our invention and not knowledge.  Hence the self is 'determined by the Non-Self.'  Since we are in the theoretical realm, 'mind' is a good stand-in term for the Self, so we can say that we are dealing with the interaction between mind and world, where the mind, in so far as it is focused on the world, takes itself to be determined by the world.

## The outline of _The Theoretical Part_
Fichte's investigation in the _Theoretical Part_ is highly structured. Fichte consistently follows a single roadmap that we present here.  Understanding the _Theoretical Part_ means understanding what is going on in this roadmap:

This diagram is to be read from top to bottom.  Fichte begins by introducing two general concepts, causality and substance, that each have a different way of specifying how the _Theoretical Principle_ works.
* Causality says that the Self and the Non-Self stand in a relationship of efficient causality to one another.  Since all positing, according to Fichte's _First Principle_ (or also the _Third Principle_), starts from the Self, the Non-Self only has reality for the Self insofar as the Self posits it.  The question is thus the following: what is causing, or _affecting_, the Self to posit the Non-Self, to endow it with reality, or, as Fichte also formulates it, trasfer activity to the Non-Self? The concept of causality leaves this question open, but limits the answer to two possibilities:
    1. The Self is intiating the action of the _Theoretical Principle_, affecting itself such that it posits the Non-Self.
    2. The Non-Self is initiating the of the _Theoeretical Principle_, affecting the Self, and therefore causing the Self to undergo its positing of the Non-Self.
* Substance says that Self is a substance and the Non-Self is an accident of the Self (not an _accident_ in the sense of a _mistake_, but rather in the formal philosophical sense that green is an accident of the substance tree, for example).  The notion of the Self as a substance follow more or less from the _First_ and _Third Principles_, which says that all positing is done by the Self.  Therefore Fichte can say that the Self contains the set of 'all realities'. The Non-Self is then a subset of that complete set.

From here, Fichte wants to develop a more detailed picture of what a causal and a substantial interaction between Self and Non-Self looks like.  In order to do this, he introduces another pair of concepts, both of which can be applied to the starting cases of causality and substance.

affects theThe Self is positing itself as determined Either
    1) the Non-Self is initiating the action, meaning it affects the Self, thereby cause the Self to posit itself as determiend by the Non-Self. 


In order to explain the founding principle, Fichte employs six main concepts :
*Substance
*Causality
*Independent Activiy
*Exchange
*Form
*Matter

Each of these concepts isolate some aspect of mind-world interaction.  They are most useful in the investigation when used in combination with one another.  The six concepts divide into three pairs, each of which belongs to what we can call its own tier.  Form and matter belong to the tier of sensuousness. They are concerned with the sensuous nature of mind-world interaciton, the fact that the mind perceives the world as consisting of matter that takes on various forms.  The second tier we can call the dynamic tier. The third we can call the categorical tier.
