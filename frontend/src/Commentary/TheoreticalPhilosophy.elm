The _Theoretical Part_ of the _Wissenschaftslehre_ is concerned with how we know things about the world.  It investigates this question by explaining how the founding principle of theoretical philosophy, which we can simply refer to as the _Theoretical Principle_ is possible.  The _Theoretical Principle_ says the following:
~~~The self sets itself as determined by the Non-Self.
Das Ich setzt sich als bestimmt durch das Nicht-Ich.~~~
We can parse this principle as follows: the knowledge that we have about the world is our knowledge, since we are the ones doing the knowing.  Hence the formulation that 'the self sets itself'.  However, that which we have knowledge of is not of our making, but rather concerns the world. We must comply with what the world presents to us, otherwise it's our invention and not knowledge.  Hence the self is 'determined by the Non-Self.'  Since we are in the theoretical realm, 'mind' is a good stand-in term for the Self, so we can say that we are dealing with the interaction between mind and world, where the mind, in so far as it is focused on the world, takes itself to be determined by the world.


## The different stages of _The Theoretical Part_
Fichte's goal is this section is to figure out how the _Theoretical Principle_ is possible, and that means resolving its central contradiction.  On the one hand, the Non-Self is determining the Self.  On the other, the Self is _taking itself_ to be determined, and this act of _taking onself_ to be something is also a kind of determination.  Thus, determination flows in two contradictory directions.  The Non-Self _determines_ the Self.  However it is also true that the Self is _determining_ this determination of the Self by the Non-Self. So which of the two entities is ultimately determining the other?

Fichte takes this contradiction to be his formulation of the contradiction between realism and idealism.  A realist would say that the Non-Self is ultimately the cause of the Self taking itself to be determined by the Non-Self.  An idealist would argue that in fact the Self is determining or causing the determination, or limitation, that the Non-Self appears to be imposing on the Self.  In this latter case, the _Theoretical Principle_ is a case of Self-determination, in the former, the Self is being determined by something outside itself, namely the Non-Self.

In order to resolve this contradiciton between realism and idealism, Fichte uses a two-step procedure consisting of an analytical phase followed by a synthetic phase.  In the analytic phase, Fichte distinguishes between the idealist and realist aspects at work in the interaction between Self and Non-Self.  In the synthetic phase, Fichte plays out the aspects out against each other, considering first the idealist scenario in which the idealist aspect explains, or forms the ground of, the realist aspect, and then considering the realist scenario in which the opposite is the case. Then, to conclude the synthetic phase, Fichte considers the third possibility in which the idealist and realist aspects mutual determine one another.  It is always this third scenario of mutual determination that moves Fichte closer to the account he holds to be correct.  With each successive synthesis, new details emerge about his account until finally culminating in the theory of the check.

## An example analysis and synthesis

Before we take a look at how Fichte lays out his various analyses and syntheses, it helps to consider just one such analysis and synthesis in order to get a more concrete sense of how such a process works.  The analysis we will consider is the distinction between form and matter under the concept of causality.  In this analysis, Fichte is assuming that the Self and Non-Self stand in a relationship of efficient causality, where the Non-Self is acting causally on the Self.  The analysis consists in identifying the formal and the material aspects of such an interaction.

In the _Theoretical Part_, we can very roughly say that the term __matter__ represents that which resides in an entity, whereas __form__ signifies the link or concantenation of entities into a larger unity.  Thus, in identifying the 'matter' of causal interaction, we have to ask: what resides in the Self and the Non-Self such that the Non-Self can causally affect the Self?  Fichte's answer here is that this matter has to be an activity of the Non-Self.  The affectation of the Self by the Non-Self cannot come from the Self itself, because this would mean that the Self is the origin of its own passivity, or suffering.  Fichte rejects such a possibility, on the grounds of his first principle, which says that the Self posits its own being. Any negation of its being must therefore come from outside the Self.

To identify the __form__ of the interaction between Self and Non-Self, we have to ask how it is that the passive, or suffering Self and the active Non-Self are even brought into a relationship of causality in the first place.  Fichte answers here that such a connection is possible because the Self __transfers__ its activity to the Non-Self.  Without this transference of activity to the Non-Self, the Non-Self would not even exist for the Self, for, according to what we learn in the the first principle, everything that exists for the Self, the Self has to posit.  Thus, the Self establishes a relationship of causalty by transfering activity activity over to the Non-Self, and observing that it has lost some of its own activity.  This alleged suffering, or loss of the Self's activity, is in fact activity of the Self that has been transferred over and attributed to the Non-Self.

With these delineations of form and matter, Fichte has reproduced the fundamental contradiction of the __Theoretical Principle__.  The material aspect of causal interaction points to the activity of the Non-Self as the ground of the __Theoretical Principle__, whereas the formal aspect of causal interaction points to the positing activity of the Self as the ground of the __Theoretical Principle__.  Now Fichte is in a position to play these possibilities out against each other and, in so doing, find the middle ground between the two options, or the 'synthesis' that will lead to his own philosophy.

The first case that Fichte considers is that the form of causal interaction determines the material.  Based on the definitions of form and matter, we can see that this leads to an idealist position, for this means that the activity of the Non-Self only exists insofar as the Self transfers its own activity over to the Non-Self.  Here, the Self, without any external influence, generates the activity of the Non-Self, and therefore also generates the representations of objective reality that appear to the Self.  Fichte calls this a dogmatic idealist position and suggests that Leibniz's preestablished harmony is such an example of this position. According to the example of Leibniz's preestablished harmony, the Self represents a monad in Leibniz's system that is generating its relections of the universe according to its ability and in a pre-established harmony with other reflecting monads.

The second case is where the matter determines the form, which would mean that the activity of the Non-Self is causing the Self to transfer its activity over to the Non-Self.  Here, the Self's representations, the so-called transference of the Self's activity, have its efficient cause in the Non-Self, so that the Non-Self causes the Self to produce these representations.  Fichte calls this a dogmatic realism, and his example is Spinoza's philosophy, according to which the Self is through-and-through determined by a nexus of efficient causes.

The synthesis of form and matter consists in arguing that form and matter 'mutually determine one another', so that the activity of the Non-Self determines the transference of the Self, and, visa versa, the transference of the Self determines the activity of the Non-Self.  Fichte also describes the synthesis as saying that the form and the matter of causal interaction are 'one and the same'.  One way to understand this is to say that  the form and matter of causal interaction emerge at one and the same moment.  At the very moment that the Non-Self affects the Self, the Self transfers its activity over to the Non-Self, and visa versa, so that one side of the action never occurs without the other.  Fichte calls such a position a 'critical idealism' and equates it with Kant's theoretical philosophy.  The pieces of Kant's philosophy that Fichte is obstensibly looking at here are, on the one hand, the affectation of the Thing-In-Itself that gives rise to the manifold of sensibility, and, on the other hand, the transcendental Self's act of subsuming the manifold under a concept and thereby bringing such a cognition up to the level of consciousness.  The subsumption of the manifold under a concept, and thereby, under the unity of apperception would be what Fichte is referring to as a 'transference' of the Self's activity to the Non-Self. In this moment, the Self is no longer positing itself, but rather an object, or something outside its, i.e. a Non-Self.  The affectation of the transcendental Self by the Thing-in-itself is in Fichte's terminology the activity of the Non-Self that is causally determining the Self.  One might note here that Kant specifically argues against applying a concept like efficient causality to transcendental entities such as the Thing-in-itself and the transcendental subject.  Fichte, however, is following Jacobi's criticism that there is no other way to understand the notion of 'affection' if not by the concept of efficient causality.

We thus have here an example of an analysis and synthesis of the __Theoretical Principle__. The analysis used the concepts of form and matter to split the interaction described in the __Theoretical Principle__ into an idealist and a realist account.   The synthesis then sought out a middle path between realism and idealism by arguing for the mutual determination, or identity of the material and formal aspects of the interaction.  The middle path that such a process unearthed is no other than Kant's account of theoretical philosophy.  Fichte, however, believes that Kant does not have the final say here.  This particular analysis and synthesis works within a larger framework of analyses and syntheses that we describe below.  It is this larger framework of analyses and syntheses that ultmiately lead Fichte to his monist theory of the check. 

## The system of analyses and syntheses

In the previous section, we described how the form and matter of causal interaction form the idealist and realist sides, respectively, of the __Theoretical Principle__.  These complementary concepts of form and matter allow us first to split, or analyse the __Theoretical Principle__ into two separate, conflicting parts, and then use the complementary nature of the leading concepts to find a synthesis that leads to an understanding of how theoretical knowledge is possible.  The entirety of the _Theoretical Part_ of the _Wissenschaftslehre_ consists of several analyses and their accompanying syntheses, whose arrangement and interrelation to one another are the subject of this section.

Fichte identifies a total of three different pairs of complementary concepts that he believes come to bear on _Theoretical Principle_.  In addition to the distinction between form and matter, Fichte singles out the distinction between causality and substance as one such pairing, and also the distinction between what we can call empirical and transcendnetal interaction.  These three analyses do not occur separately, but are rather additive, in the sense that every side of each analysis combines all the other concepts of the other analyses. What this means concretely is that Fichte begins by distinguishing between causal interaction and substantial interaction, the former which leads to a realist understanding of the _Theoretical Principle_, the latter to an idealist understanding.  Having made that distinction, he then further distinguishes between two types of causal interaction, and two types of substantial interaction.  Causal interaction can be applied to the transcendental entities of the Self and the Non-Self, and to regular empirical objects.  The same holds true for substantial interaction.  When we are in the realm of trascendedental interaction, we are taking an idealist view of things, and when we are in the empirical realm, we are viewing things as a realist would.  Finally, each of these four types of interactions divides into their formal and material aspects, so that we end up with a total of four separate distinctions between form and matter: @@Image@@

The analysis that we handled in the previous section is thus in fact the analysis of form and matter under the concept of transcendnetal causal interaction.  As can be seen from that example, it is always the most immediate analysis, so in this case the form-matter distinction that determines if we are dealing with an idealist or a realist view of things.

Just as the analyses are cumulative, so are the syntheses.  The synthesis stage consists in cumulatively synthesizing each finer analysis into a synthesis, and then synthesizing those syntheses into larger syntheses.  So, for example, the form and matter or causal trascendental interaction are synthesized. Then the form and matter of causal empirical interaction are synthesized. Then, the synthesized notion of transcendental causal interaction is synthesized with the synthesizedntion of empirical causal interaction.  Interestingly, Fichte does not provide a final synthesis of causal and substantial interaction, and one can speculate on whether this is an oversight on his part, or if he perhaps has a good reason for doing so. Regardless of this open question, we can observe the clear tendency of these successive analyses and syntheses.  With each analyses, Fichte is able to isolate a separate aspect of his _Theoretical Principle_, and with each synthesis, he is able to move toward his final monist theory of the check.

## The significance of the system of analyses and syntheses

Before looking at each analysis and synthesis in deatil, it is helpful to consider the larger significance of this particular arrangement of analyses and syntheses that Fichte chooses.  Nowhere else in his writings does Fichte proceed in such an ordered fashion.  His strict adherence here to the three pairs of complementary concepts is reminiscent of Kant's strict orientation around the table of categories in the _Critique of Pure Reason_.  There can be no doubt that Fichte considers these six concepts to be the cornerstones of his theoretical philosophy.  He spends considerable time drawing own these distinctions, and then, in the course his syntheses, transforming our understanding of them to fit the monist philosophy that he ultimately wants to advance. We can therefore understand the overall tendency of the _Theoretical Part_ by summarizing how Fichte first introduces each of these six concepts and how our understanding of them morphes in the course of the various synthses.

* Causality: This concept requires the least explanation, for it is, plain, and simple, the concept of efficient causality.  Applied to the _Theoretical Principle_, the idea is that the Non-Self is causally affecting the Self, and this explains why the Self posits itself as determined by the Non-Self.  It's a fundamentally realist position.  However, as we saw in the example above, Fichte can also extract from this concept an idealist position by arguing that in order for the Self to be aware of the causal determination by the Non-Self, it has to both posit the active Non-Self, and bring this activity of the Non-Self in connection with its own loss of activity.  In the syntheses of causality, these two realist and idealist positions take on some finer points, but the dilemma always remains that the source of the Self's determination by the Non-Self has to ultimately have its source either in the Self, or the Non-Self.  It is only in the syntheses of substance that Fichte overcomes this dilemma by showing that the concept of causality itself contains a fundamentally dualist assumption about the existence of the Self and Non-Self as two separate entities.  Once one understands how two distinct entities such as Self and Non-Self emerge in the first place, this dualist assumption is replaced by a monist understanding.  According to the monist picture, Self and Non-Self emerge through the activity of the imagination and the understanding that kick into gear when the 'striving activity' of the Self is 'checked' or encounters 'resistance'.  We will fill out this picture later, but we can remark here that terms like 'check' or 'resistance' seek to avoid as much as possible the dualist assumption that a Non-Self exists over and against the Self.  Rather than a Non-Self causally affecting the Self, we simply have a Self that, in the course of its activity, encounters resistance and then keeps going by coalescing this experience of resistence into the notion of a Non-Self.

* Substance: The concept of substance is the most important of the six concepts, and the keystone of Fichte's monism.  Within the the _Theoretical Philosophy_, it holds onto the idea from the _First Principle_ that all positing is done by the Self, and therefore everything posited must be posited by the Self.  Fichte defines a substance as 'something that is all encompassing' and applies the concept to Self as follows:
~~~The Self is a substance, in so far as we view it as encompassing the entire, absolutely determined ambit of all realities.~~~
The notion of the Self as substance does justice to the fact that the Self is the subject of the _Theoretical Principle_. Nothing other than the Self can set the Self 'as determined by the Non-Self', for only the Self has the ability to posit in the first place. The problem with the concept of substance, as Fichte sees it, is that it leaves both the concept of determination and the concept of the Non-Self problmenatic.   If all reality belongs to the Self, then the Non-Self is not really a Non-Self at all, but rather just an accident of the Self.  Similarly, why should the Self, which as substance is absolute, put any limitation on itself in the first place?

We can see in the definition and problems of substance, that this concept forms an idealist counterpart to the realist concept of causality.


The analyses and syntheses of substance work toward answering the open question regarding the Self as substance.








 In fact, however, the synthesis of form and matter under the concept of efficient causality contains itself a realist assumption, namely that the Non-Self is causally affecting the Self.  As a complement to the realist concept of efficient causality, Fichte introduces the concept of substance.

The analysis and synthesis covered in the previous section made a number of assumptions

that the Self has, are created by the Self without any influence from the outside.      There is no causal affection from outside of the Self, but merely the appearance of one, for all  activity of the Non-Self is in fact simply activity of Self.  



We can see in how Fichte draw these distinctions an echo of Kant's distinction between the matter of sensibility and the form of concepts.  According to Kant, the subject unifies a manifold of intuition by applying the form of a concept.  In Kant's system, the matter is the manifold, and the form is the concept.  Fichte is adapting this model to concern not the objects of experience, but rather the Self and Non-Self, or what Kant would call the transcendental Self and the Thing-in-itself.  The question here is not how two parts of the manifold are unified under the concept causality, but rather how the Self connects its representations to a  matter of experience in general is posited by a subject acheives its form as being posited  the  here to be taking taking the matter and its unification under a concept apply not to objects of experience, but rather to the Self and the Non-Self themselves.  

(Here the concept of causaity and the matter of causality refers not to an object of cognition, but to the Self and the Non-Self in general.)
In Fichte's case the Self is taking itself to be causally determined by the outside world. The world provides the matter of cognition by affecting the Self, whereas the Self, in __taking__ itself to be causality determined, is applying the concept, or __form__, of causality
As difficult and perhaps dubious as these derivations of _form_ and _matter_ might seem, they put Fichte in a position to 




The Self connects the the In order for this to happen, we, or some other intelligent being, has to connect the passivity or limitation observed in the Self with the activity observed in the Non-Self.  Only when this connection happens do we identify the activity of the Non-Self as the efficient cause of the passivity of the Self.      


The unity, or form, of causal interaction consists in recognizing that two apparently distinct things, i.e. the Self's passivity and the Non-Self's activity, are in fact two aspects of one single event, namely a causal affection of the Self on the part of the Non-Self.  Fichte's

Fichte's derivation of the material and form aspects of the interaction works as follows.  If we assume that the Non-Self is causally affecting the Self, then this requires two pieces: an initial activity of the Non-Self that is doing the affecting, and a passivity, or suffering of the Self that is the result of this activity of affection.  The matter is here that which both pieces have in common, namely, the activity of the Non-Self, for the activity that begins with the Non-Self, carries over into the Self and thereby determines the passivity we observe in the Self.  Another way to say this is that both Self and Non-Self are permiated by a single activity that originates in the Non-Self.  Whereas the __material__ of the interaction refers to some common characteristc that both Self and Non-Self share, the __form__ of the interaction refers to

The converse is also true: the Non-Self's activity is how the Self's passivity expresses itself in the context of the Self.

According to Fichte,  


* In order for these two pieces, the activity of the Non-Self, and the passivity of the Self, to be connected to one another, i.e. parts of one and the same action, there must be a common medium, or substrate that allows the activity of the Non-Self to carry over into the Self as passivity, or suffering of the Self. If there wasn't such a common ground, then there is no reason that the activity outside the Self, i.e. in the Non-Self, would carry over into the Self, where it becomes manifest as the Self's passivity, or suffering.  The substrate, which subtends both the active Non-Self and the passive Self, is what Fichte calls matter.  This matter has the characteristic that it is imbued with an activity that explains both the activity of the Non-Self and the effect of suffering, or  

In the synthesis phase...


## The arrangment of analyses and syntheses





Fichte aims to resolve this contradiction by playing out the realist scenario against the idealist scenario.  After considering each branch of the contradiction in turn, Fichte then  identifying its two competing sides with two complementary pairs of philosophical terms that normally appear together.  Once such pair of terms that Fichte identifies is form and matter.  Fichte in fact introduces two additional complementary pairs of terms as well, but for now we can work with a simplified model so as to more generally describe Fichte's procedure.  With the help of these two complementary terms, Fichte can then resolve the contradiction by showing that the two sides of the _Theoretical Principle_ are in fact not in contradiction with one another, but rather mutually constitute one another in a relationship of complementarity.

Fichte divides this overall procedure into two stages, an analytic and a synthetic stage. In the analytic stgae, he describes the contradiciton of the _Theoretical Principle_ in terms of a tension beween his two philosophical terms, in our case form and matter.  In the syntehtic phase he argues for the complementarity of the two sides of the contradiction, thereby transforming the apparent contradiction into a unified account of the _Theoretical Principle_.


Let us now walk through this procedure with form and matter.  In the analytical stage, we identify a formal aspect and a material aspect at work in the contradictory acts of the Self and the Non-Self each trying to determine the other.  We can accomplish this by observing that the world consists of sensous matter that is arranged in various forms.  If we express this distinction in terms of perception, then we can say that to percieve the world is to percieve a senuous mannifold (matter) that we then synthesize into unified forms. So, for example, in perceiving a table, all of the senous matter that belongs to the table would be unified according to our perception in the form of the table.  Such a way of looking at things allows us to attribute the sensous matter to the Non-Self, and the unification of the matter into a specific form, to the determining act of the perceiving Self.  Thus, we can say that the Self is the determining agent in the _Theoretical Principle_ in so far as it provides the sensuous forms that we perceive in the act of cognition, and the Non-Self is the determining agent in the _Theoretical Principle_ in so far as it provides the sensuous matter.  The formal determination of our world is a act of the Self, and the material determination of our world is an act of the Non-Self.

It shoudl be noted that such a division of form to the Self and matter to the Non-Self follows Kant's account in the _Critique of Pure Reason_ (and even more obviously Rheinhold's account in his _Elementary Philosophy_).  According to Kant, the manifold of sensibility is supplied to the conscious subject through affection by the Thing-in-Itself, and the subject then unifies this manifold by applying a concept to the manifold.  When this application of a concept occurs, we percieve a unified sensuous form that is a product of our determination, filled with the matter of sensisibility that the Thing-in-itself supplied.  Fichte is thus working along Kantian lines, whereby the matter belongs to the Non-Self, and the form to the Self.

In the next stage, the synthesis, the question is which of the two aspects, i.e. matter or form, determines the other.  At stake here is the question of which entity, the Self or the Non-Self, is ultimately the determining agent in the _Theoretical Principle_, and thus whether we are dealing with a case of idealism or realism.  Of course, Fichte wants to claim that neither of the two is the determining aspect, and that these aspects in fact mutually determine one another.  Before he does that, however, he considers each side of the contradiction in order to then more fully articulate the middle path that takes to be the correct account.

In the idealist side of the dilemma, we consider what it means to say that form determines matter. 

The analysis occurs by distinguishing between form and matter. Such a distinction 
allows us to tease apart two aspects that are in tension with one another in the _Theoretical Principle_.  
The distinction between form and matter allows us to 1) articuate this contradiction more fully and then 2)provide a resolution to this contradiction.  The first step is the analysis, the second is the synthesis.  



We can roughly divide the phases of Fichte's investigation into three stages:
1.  The analysis stage.  In this stage, Fichte introduces a series of six concepts that he believes are essential to explain the _Theoretical Principle_.  He uses these six concepts to distinguish eights aspects at work in this principle. 
2.  The synthesis stage.  In this stage, Fichte synthesizes the eight aspects of the _Theoretical Principle_.  A synthesis consists is showing how two aspects, one which is realist, and another which is idealist, mutually determine each other to arrive at an account that is neither realist nor idealist.
3.  At the conclusion of the second stage, Fichte puts forth a new account that is markedly different in character from the _idealist_ and _realist_ accounts he has thus far set up. Whereas the previous accounts are all dualist in that they assume a Self and a Not-Self as their starting point, this account is monist, since it takes the Self to be the starting point, and then describes how a Not-Self emerges from the Self.  This is Fichte's so-called 'theory of the _check_' (Anstosslehre), and the remainder of the _Theoretical Part_ is devoted to fleshing out this account.

The guiding thread throughout all three stages of the _Theoretical Part_ are the six guiding concepts that Fichte employs in a highly structured manner that we can map out as follows:

We can overlay the three stages idenitfied above on this roadmap as follows:

We are going to have to take several passes at explaining this diagram, for it is very abstract and requires a lot of explanation before its meaning becomes clearer.  The diagram is to be read from top to bottom, and then, approximately, from left to right.

In the analysis stage, Fichte is introducing his six concepts. First he introduces the concepts of causality and substance - as shown at the top of the diagram. Next, he introduces the concepts of an _exchange of activity and passivity_, or _exchange_ for short, and then the concept of independent activity. These two concepts are then applied as special cases to the concepts of causality and substance, so that we have four different possibilities for explaining the _Theoretical Principle_, namely causal exchange, causal idenpendent activity, substantial exchange, and substantial independent activity.  In the last step of stage 1, Fichte introduces the concepts of form and matter, and applies these as further specifications to the four-fold division of the last step.  Thus, at the end of stage 1, we have the material aspect of causal exchange and the formal aspect of causal exchange. Then we have the material aspect of independent activity, and so on.

In the synthesis stage, Fichte shows how the various aspects he has identified mutually determine one another.  There are a total of six synthesis: material exhange causation synthesized with formal exchange causation, material independent activity in causation with material independent activity in causation, etc.  Each of the six syntheses in the digram follows an the same procedure.  First, Fichte considers what it means to say that one aspect determines the other.  Then, Fichte completes the synthesis by showing how the two aspects mutually determine each other.

The final, sixth synthesis, is the point at which Fichte arrives at the explaination of the _Theoretical Principle_ that he considers to be an accurate explanation.

## The outline of the _Theoretical Part_ in slightly more detail

Let us now look at the analytic and synthetic phases in more detail.  For convienience of explanation, we can start in the middle of the digramn with the concepts of form and matter, since these are concepts that are least bound to the idiosyncracies of Fichte's system.  Let us more away from the diagram and consider form and matter just by themselves, unconnected to the other two levels of distinction.

 and explaining how these concepts combine so as to isolate eight different aspects of the _Theoretical Principle_.  In stage two, Fichte is showing how these six concepts, or eight aspects work together to form incomplete accounts of the _Theoretical Principle_.  In stage 3, we then get the complete, or the monist theory of the check.

Let's look at each stage in more detail.

### Stage 1

Fichte begins by introducing two general concepts, causality and substance, that each have a different way of specifying how the _Theoretical Principle_ works.
* _Causality_ says that the Self and the Non-Self stand in a relationship of efficient causality to one another.  Since all positing, according to Fichte's _First Principle_ (or also the _Third Principle_), starts from the Self, the Non-Self only has reality for the Self insofar as the Self posits it.  The question is thus the following: what is causing, or _affecting_, the Self to posit the Non-Self, to endow it with reality, or, as Fichte also formulates it, trasfer activity to the Non-Self? The concept of causality leaves this question open, but limits the answer to two possibilities:
    1. The Self is initiating the action of the _Theoretical Principle_, affecting itself such that it posits the Non-Self.
    2. The Non-Self is initiating the action of the _Theoeretical Principle_, affecting the Self, and therefore causing the Self to undergo its positing of the Non-Self.
* _Substance_ says that Self is a substance and the Non-Self is an accident of the Self (not an _accident_ in the sense of a _mistake_, but rather in the formal philosophical sense that green is an accident of the substance tree, for example).  The notion of the Self as a substance follows more or less from the _First_ and _Third Principles_, which say that all positing is done by the Self.  Therefore Fichte can say that the Self contains the set of 'all realities'. The Non-Self is then a subset of that complete set of all realities.

This explains the first division at the top of the diagram.  The next division comes because Fichte wants to develop a more detailed picture of what a causal and a substantial interaction between Self and Non-Self looks like.  In order to do this, he introduces another pair of concepts, _exchange_ and _independent activity_, both of which can be applied to the cases of causality and substance.
* The _exchange of activity and passivity_, also simply called an _exchange_, describes a situation in which one entity is determining another.  Any amount of activity in the one enitity, corresponds to the exact same amount of passivity, or suffering, in the other. The active entity is determining the passive entity, which is absorbing, or taking in the activity of the active entity.  It is called an _exchange_ or _interaction_, because the activity of the one entity fully determines the passivity of the other, and visa versa.  Thus is specificies a formula for _exchanging_ the activity or passivity observed in the one entity with activity or passivity that must be occuring in the other.  The specific exchange that interests Fichte in the _Theoretical Part_ is the activity of the Non-Self and its correspondence to the passivity of the Self.   
* Whereas an exchange of activity and passivity applies to any kind of object, and most notably physical objects, indendent activity is an activity that allows the Self to be aware of the exchange with the Non-Self in which it is engaged.  The first concept, _exchange_ would be enough to explain that the Non-Self determines  Self, for it says that the Non-Self acts on the passive Self.  However, the _Theoretical Principle_ also says that the Self posits itself _as_ determined by the Non-Self.  It is thus important not only that the Non-Self determine the Self, but also that the Self be aware of this determination.  Fichte calls this awareness _independent activity_ because he considers being aware to be an _act_. This _act_ or _activity_ is _independent_ in that it is not caught up in the direct _exchange_ between the Non-Self and the Self.  The passivity of the Self, when it is being determined by the Non-Self, does not affect the activity that goes into being aware of its passivity.   

Fichte now applies these two concepts to the two concepts of causality and substance so as to now describe four different aspects at play in the _Theoretical Principle_.

* Causal exchange: As one would imagine it.

* Causal independent activity: Activity of the Non-Self.

* Substantial exchange: A second state comes in that negates the totality of the first state.

* Substantial indendendent activity: Imagination.  Comparing the signle state to the shared state.

The last step involves introducing the formal and material aspects of these four aspects.
Fichte defines form and matter in a very abstract manner.

Matter and form are guided by the notions of sensuous matter and form.  It takes some effort to see this.


### Stage 2
  What does it mean to have one concept 'determine' the other?  What does it mean to have form determine matter, and visa versa? The matter explains the form.  The form explains the matter.


### Stage 3
 The tendency of _The Theoretical Part_.
