The _Theoretical Part_ of the _Wissenschaftslehre_ is concerned with how we know things about the world.  Fichte's describes it as an investigation into resolving the contradictions contained in the founding principle on theoretical philosophy:
~~~The self sets itself as determined by the Non-Self.
Das Ich setzt sich als bestimmt durch das Nicht-Ich.~~~
The knowledge that we have about the world is our knowledge, since we are the ones doing the knowing.  Hence the formulation that 'the self sets itself'.  However, that which we have knowledge of is not of our making, but rather concerns the world. We must comply with what the world presents to us, otherwise it's invention and not knowledge.  Hence the self is 'determined by the Non-Self.'  Since we are in the theoretical realm, 'mind' is a good standin for the Self, so we can say that we are dealing with the interaction between mind and world.

## The outline of _The Theoretical Part_
Fichte's investigation in the _Theoretical Part_ is highly structured.  In order to explain the founding principle, Fichte employs six main concepts :
*Substance
*Causality
*Independent Activiy
*Exchange
*Form
*Matter

Each of these concepts isolate some aspect of mind-world interaction.  They are, however, most useful in the investigation when used in combination with one another.  The six concepts divide into three pairs, each of which belongs to its own tier.  Form and matter below to the tier of sensuousness. They concerns the sensuous nature of mind-world interaciton, the fact that mind perceives the world as consisting of matter that takes on various forms.  The second tier is the dynamic tier. The third is the categorical tier.
