# The Wissenschaftslehre
## A User's Guide

This site is intended to serve as a reference for reading Fichte's 1794 _Grundlage der Gesamten Wissenschaftslehre_.  The 1794 _Grundlage_ is the only complete version that Fichte published of his philosophical system.  At the same time, it is very difficult to understand and the secondary literature does not tend to get into the nuts and bolts of the text.

This guide explains the text in the simplest terms possible, often using visual diagrams to explain what is happening.
