Introduction

This essay interpets Fichte's theoretical philosophy from his 1794 Foundation as a philosophy primarily concerned with the role that negation plays in judgement.  One of the basic tenets of Fichte's philosophy is that human judgement is a spontaneous act. A judgment has no cause outside itself; it is its own cause; it determines itself; etc.  According to this interpretation, Fichte is attempting to answer a challenge that inevitably arises once one assumes the premise of spontaneous judgement: assuming judgement to be spontaneous, how is it possible for empirical judgement to have any grip on empirical reality?  Judgements about empirical reality must, as such, be answerable to empirical reality.  I can judge, for example, that there is a tree outside my window, and it can turn out that I was mistaken - there is in fact no tree outside my window.  My judgement, in other words, is answerable to an objective standard, namely to the state of affairs in empirical reality.  However, if our judgements concerning empirical reality are themselves self-causing, self constraining, self-determining, etc., then how is it that empirical reality ever gets a grip on them?  Where, in our act of making an empirical judgement, do we allow empirical reality to weigh in on, or determine our judgement?

The picture that emerges in Fichte's theoretical philosophy as a response to this challenge can be summarized as follows:
-Empirical judgement has a grip on objective reality because every empirical judgement can err.
-The feature of empirical judgement that allows for it to err is negation. Any empirical judgement (and indeed judgement in general) can be described as either the affirmation or negation of a proposition.
-Affirmative and negative judgement are intimately connected.  We can say that negation that dwells within every affirmative judgement and thereby secures the falsifiability of our empirical judgements. In other words, falsifiability is immanent to every empirical judgement because negation is immanent to every assertoric proposition.
-The ability to consider both a proposition and its negation is secured by a capacity that Fichte calls the imagination (Einbildungskraft).

Equally important to understanding Fichte's theoretical philosophy is to understand what Fichte demarcates as not explained in his theory.
-The consciousness, or mind, is the source of judgement. Since these judgements don't have a mechanical origin, as would be the case, for example, if consciousness were determiend by efficient causes, there is no explanation for how empirical judgements arise. They simply do.
-Even though Fichte is out to show that empirical judgement is, by its very nature, negatable, he has no explanation for how, in actuality, incorrect empirical judgements are corrected. He theory ends with two irreconcible possibilities to explain this, namely, 1) a self-correcting, spontaneous capacity of mind to correct false judgements, or 2) an external check (Anstoss) on, or resistence (Wiedestand) to, false judgement that somehow induces the mind to correct its false judgement.

The remainder of this essay consists in fleshing out this initial summary of Fichte's theoretical philosophical by going through key passages in his text.

Exegetical Note

In the Foundation of Theoretical Knowledge, Fichte only occasional mentions judgements and negation. Thus it might seem that viewing this text through such a lense must inevitably distort it. However, we believe that framing his investigation in terms of judgement and negation simplifies and concretizes a very complex and abstract investigation that otherwise remains beyond our grasp. As we will see, many of Fichfe's distictions and arguments begin to make sense when presented in our interpretive terms.
