Introduction

This essay interpets Fichte's theoretical philosophy from his 1794 Foundation as a philosophy primarily concerned with the role that negation plays in judgement.  One of the basic tenets of Fichte's philosophy is that human judgement is a spontaneous act. A judgment has no cause outside itself; it is its own cause; it determines itself; etc.  According to this interpretation, Fichte is attempting to answer a challenge that inevitably arises once one assumes the premise of spontaneous judgement: assuming judgement to be spontaneous, how is it possible for empirical judgement to have any grip on empirical reality?  Judgements about empirical reality must, as such, be answerable to empirical reality.  I can judge, for example, that there is a tree outside my window, and it can turn out that I was mistaken - there is in fact no tree outside my window.  My judgement, in other words, is answerable to an objective standard, namely to the state of affairs in empirical reality.  However, if our judgements concerning empirical reality are themselves self-causing, self constraining, self-determining, etc., then how is it that empirical reality ever gets a grip on them?  Where, in our act of making an empirical judgement, do we allow empirical reality to weigh in on, or determine our judgement?

The picture that emerges in Fichte's theoretical philosophy as a response to this challenge can be summarized as follows:
-Empirical judgement has a grip on objective reality because every empirical judgement can err.
-The feature of empirical judgement that allows for it to err is negation. Any empirical judgement (and indeed judgement in general) can be described as either the affirmation or negation of a proposition.
-Affirmative and negative judgement are intimately connected.  We can say that negation that dwells within every affirmative judgement and thereby secures the falsifiability of our empirical judgements. In other words, falsifiability is immanent to every empirical judgement because negation is immanent to every assertoric proposition.
-The cognitive feature that tethers negation to all propositions such that negation dwells as an possibility within that proposition Fichte calls imagination (Einbildungskraft).

Equally important to understanding Fichte's theoretical philosophy is to understand what Fichte demarcates as not explained in his theory.
-The consciousness, or mind, is the source of judgement. Since these judgements don't have a mechanical origin, as would be the case, for example, if consciousness were determiend by efficient causes, there is no explanation for how empirical judgements arise. They simply do.
-Even though Fichte is out to show that empirical judgement is, by its very nature, negatable, he has no explanation for how, in actuality, incorrect empirical judgements are corrected. His theory ends with two irreconcible possibilities to explain this, an "idealist" and a "realist" position. The idealist position explains empirical judgement via a spontaneous and self-correcting capacity of mind that has a concept of false judgements and an ability to correct them. The realist position explains empirical judgement via an an external check (Anstoss) on, or resistence (Wiedestand) to, spontaneously generated false judgement that somehow induces, or causes, the mind to correct its false judgement.

The remainder of this essay consists in fleshing out this initial summary of Fichte's theoretical philosophical by going through key passages in his text.

Exegetical Note

In the Foundation of Theoretical Knowledge, Fichte only occasionally mentions judgements. Thus it might seem that viewing this text through such a lense must inevitably distort it. However, we believe that framing his investigation in terms of judgement and negation simplifies and concretizes a very complex and abstract investigation that otherwise remains beyond our grasp. As we will see, many of Fichfe's distictions and arguments begin to make sense when presented in our interpretive terms.

The Basic Setup

Fichte presents his theoretical philosophy as the unfolding of a single foundational principle:

```
Das Self posits itself as determined by the Non-Self.
```

We can make sense of this principle in the context of empirical judgements. According to this interpretation, the "Self" refers to the agent who judges, and the "Non-Self" refers to an empirical reality to which this agent's judgements are directed. To say that the Self posits itself as determined by the Non-Self is to say that our judgings take as their measure of correctness the state of affairs in the empirical world. But how are our judgements about empirical reality correctable if all judging springs from the Self? The determination that a judgement is correct or incorrect is itself a judgement, that would in turn require another judgement to determine its correctness, as so on ad infinitum. The self-sufficient nature of judging, what Fichte captures with his, admittedly broader and fuzzier concept of positing, seems to leave no room for determination 'from outside'.

And yet, as Fichte is noting in his foundational principle of theoretical knowledge, we take our judgements about empirical reality to be objective. Our judgements about reality are valid not because they come from us, but because they conform to reality.

In order to consider how it is possible for reality to weigh in on our judgements, Fichte introduces the concept of "interdetermination" or, as he calls it later, an "exchange of activity and suffering". This phenomenon is none other than the principle of non-contradiction in disguise. The principle of non-contradiction says that two contradictory principles cannot at the same time hold. In Fichte's terminology, the "reality" of Thing 1 implies the "negation" of Thing 2, and, visa versa, the "reality" of Thing 2 implies the "negation" of Thing 1.

Fichte calls this "interdetermination" because one can use the reality of one thing to determine the negation of another. Similarly, this is an "exchange of activity and suffering" because the "reality" or "activity" of one thing, "transfers over" or "exchanges" in the "negation" or "suffering" of that other thing.

Reality manifests its ability to determine our judgements when when we take our judgements to be false. In taking a judgement to be false, we have to give up the previous judgement that we first took to be true. This act of reliquishing our previous judgement for the negation of that judgement is dictated by the principle of non-contradiction, when doesn't permitt us to simultaneously hold to our old proposition p and our new proposition not-p, but rather compels us in accepting not-p to reject p.

In Fichte's terms, empirical reality, or the Not-Self, is the that which negates our propositions, and, in so doing, allows the true propositions to stand and the false onces to fall. Each and every time that a particular judgement of ours is show to be mistaken, the general rolea of the Self and Non-Self, the judging subject and the objective world are themselves exhibited writ large. The self makes a judgement p, and reality says whether or not it will stand.

This relationship between the particular negation of a judgement, on the one hand and, other the other, the general relationship of the judging subject to reality, explains why we see Fichte present his notion of "exchange" in different guises. In the beginning of the Theoretical Part, Section B, Fichte describes the exchange between the Self and the Not-Self as negating reality in the Self, in general, and not negating the reality of a specific judgement. ("So viele Teile der Negation das Ich in sich setyt, so viele Teile der Realitaet setzt es in das Nicht-Ich"). What does it mean to negate part of the reality of the Self? If we consider the Self as the totality of its judgements, then a negation of some of these judgements would be a the partial negation of the Self that Fichte is talking about. This general view of the Self, however, is replaced later on in Section E, when Fichte discusses the "exchange" as relating not to the judgings of the Self, in general, but rather specific judgements. At this later point in his investigtion, Fichte is still interested in the general case of the judging Self and the correcting Non-Self, but we introduces a new term, namely an "independent activity" of the Self and the Non-Self that grounds, or explains the particular case of a "Wechsel" or, as we are calling it, the negation of a particular judgement. In the following section we examine this distinction between the general and particular case of negation more closely, as well as two other distinctions Fichte makes concerning the case of negation.

Gradual Refinement

As we mentioned in the introduction, Fichte holds that we lack a complete explanation for empirical judgement, or theoretical knowledge, but can at least reduce our explanation to two irreconcilable positions. One position is idealist, explaining the correction of false empirical judgement through some version of a spontaneous capacity, while the other position is realist, explaining the correction of judgement through some kind of external determination. The majority of the Theoretical Part is concerned with outlining these two positions through a process of gradual refinement. In the process of gradual refinement, Fichte begins by trying to distinguish various idealist aspects of the process of negation from relatist aspects. Fichte calls this process of drawing these distinctions "analysis". Then, in a second process that he calls "sythesis", Fichte plays the distinctions between the idealist and realist aspects of negation off against one another. In working out how these positions contradict one another and searching for their reconciliation, Fichte moves gradually from a position where idealism and realism are in complete opposition to one another, to one in which their differences are confined to a very specific moment of empirical negation, namely the moment in which the Self chooses the negation of the proposition over its affirmation.

Analysis

Fichte distinguishes three times between the idealist and realist aspects of negation, result in a total what we can call six "categories" of negation. We can summarize them in the following table, before describing them in more detail:

|                                                                       | Idealist             | Realist   |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | --------- |
| Origin of negation (internal versus external)                         | Substance            | Causality |
| Scope of negation (negation in general versus a particular negation ) | Independent Activity | Wechsel   |
| Abstraction level of negation                                         | Form                 | Matter    |

Substance and Causality

The categories of substance and causality concern whether or not we see negation as arising from inside or outside the Self. In the case of substance, the Self is viewed as containing, or being the agent of all of its judgements, including those judgements that are negated, or correct by empirical reality. In Fichtes words:

```
Substance is all exchange conceived of generally: an accident is something particular that exchanges with another exchanging thing.
There is originally only one substance, the Self.
```

According to our interpretation we are taking "exchange" to refer to the negation of a judgement. The Self is here concieved of as being the sum total off all judgements, including those that are negated.

In the case of causality, the negation of a judgement is seen as arising through a process of the Self being "affected". In such a case, there is a causal relationship between something external, an external reality, that is impigning on and determining the Self to correct its judgement from p to Not-p. In Fichte's words "The Not-Self has...for the Self reality on insofar as the Self is affected...".

Independent Activity and Exchange

We have already indicated that "exchange", which Fichte uses as short hand for "an exchange of activity and suffering", refers to the negation of a judgement, whereby the "activity" of the judgement is negated, i.e. the judgements "suffers" its negation. Such a negation always happens in the context of a Self, which is doing the judging, and a Not-Self, which, through its capacity to negate judgements, enforces the notion of an reality independent of the Self and what it might in any moment want or take to be the case. This context for negation makes clear that the Self and the Non-Self endure beyond the particular moment of negation. In contrast, a particular judgement and its negation can be fleeting - either a judgement stands, or it is eliminated. It is this enduring quality of the Self and Not-Self that prompts Fichte to refer to the overall context of negation as "indendent activity". The totality of the Self's judgements endure even when one judgement is negated, and thus this general activity of judging is "independent" from any particular judgement. And something similar holds for the Not-Self: even if empirical reality is not currently, at this moment, correcting a misjudgement, it always remains present as that principle that ensures the objective reality of the Self's empirical judgement. Without this general notion of a external corrective, the Self could not be said to have any theoretical knowledge at all, but rather uncontrolled judgements projected onto a facade of reality.

Synthesis

This processs is used to bring out the final picture that Fichte draws of negation. It always contains three steps, that we also is the final picture of negation - the idealist argument, the realistic argument, and their unity.
